Understood. Based on your full file list and the new feature requirements, here is the structured update plan for each file to implement:

âœ… Modern international-style reporting
âœ… Department-wise test loading
âœ… High/Low result indicators (with arrow symbols)
âœ… Proper linking between Reception â†’ Technician â†’ Admin â†’ Report view

---

### âœ… File Update Plan (in correct order):

#### 1. `test-data.js`
- âœ… Already done. Contains all departments + 30 tests each with normal ranges.

#### 2. `register_patient.html`
- Show department dropdown
- Auto-load tests after department selection
- Patient form stores selected department

#### 3. `reception.js`
- Save patient with department field
- Automatically redirect to `registration-slip.html` after registration

#### 4. `registration-slip.html`
- Modern slip view
- Include all patient + department + empty test list
- Show date, logo, footer

#### 5. `technician.html`
- Test input form with department filter
- High/Low indicators (ðŸ”º / ðŸ”»)
- Result entry form

#### 6. `technician.js`
- Match patient with test list by department
- Add result + compare with normal range
- Append arrow indicators

#### 7. `report.html` or `view_reports.html`
- Show patient report (department-wise)
- Show all entered results
- Modern layout, print-friendly
- Arrows for High ðŸ”º / Low ðŸ”»

#### 8. `style.css`
- Add all modern styles (card layout, tables, indicators, etc.)

#### 9. `admin.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`, `reception_dashboard.html`, `technician_dashboard.html`
- Just add "View Reports" link for each user

#### 10. `script.js`
- Shared functions like `getPatients()`, `compareRange()` etc.

#### 11. `storage.js`
- Ensure localStorage saves/reads data properly with department + test + result

#### 12. `slip.html`, `export.html`, `qr-generator.js`
- (Optional) Style matching if used for print/export

If you're ready, Iâ€™ll now begin by sending the **updated version of `register_patient.html`** with department and test integration. Shall I begin with that?
